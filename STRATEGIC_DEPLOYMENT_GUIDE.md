## VIII. RISK MITIGATION

### Budget Overruns

**Risk:** Tasks take more Manus credit than estimated

**Mitigation:**
- Track usage daily
- Prioritize critical tasks first
- Use reserve buffer for overruns
- Cut low-priority tasks if needed

### Technical Failures

**Risk:** Testnet deployment encounters critical issues

**Mitigation:**
- Allocate extra budget for debugging ($150)
- Have Claude on standby for security issues
- Use reserve buffer for emergency fixes

### Timeline Delays

**Risk:** Tasks take longer than expected

**Mitigation:**
- Build in buffer time (Week 4)
- Prioritize critical path items
- Accept that some nice-to-haves may be deferred

### Scope Creep

**Risk:** New requirements emerge mid-deployment

**Mitigation:**
- Bryan makes final call on scope changes
- Use reserve buffer for critical additions
- Defer non-critical items to post-testnet

**The Outcome:**

By December 31, 2025, we will have:
- ✅ **Functional testnet** with hardened security
- ✅ **Complete Four Windows Framework** for Gemini's V2.1 Blueprint
- ✅ **Professional visual assets** for curriculum and recruitment
- ✅ **Remnant recruitment materials** ready for outreach
- ✅ **First wave of builders** onboarded and contributing
