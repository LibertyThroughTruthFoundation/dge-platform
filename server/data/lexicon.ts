    term: "Angel Ledgers",
    definition: "The heavenly record-keeping system described in 1 Enoch, where angels maintain accounts of all transactions, covenants, and stewardship on earth.

    term: "Divine Measure",

    term: "The Elect One",

    term: "Rest as Authority",

  {
    term: "Piloting the Permanent",
