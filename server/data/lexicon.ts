    term: "Angel Ledgers",
    definition: "Drawing on the biblical and Enochian imagery of heavenly record-keeping (1 Enoch 60-61; Revelation 20:12), this framework proposes that all economic stewardship is witnessed and accountable. The heavenly record-keeping system described in 1 Enoch, where angels maintain accounts of all transactions, covenants, and stewardship on earth, finds contemporary expression in the DGE's token system—reflecting the principle that all economic activity is witnessed in the heavenly realms. (See George Nickelsburg, *1 Enoch 1*, Fortress, 2001; Michael Heiser, *The Unseen Realm*, Lexham, 2015)",

  {
    term: "Divine Measure",
    definition: "The unchanging standard by which all value, justice, and exchange are weighed in the kingdom economy. Unlike fiat currencies that fluctuate based on human manipulation, Divine Measure represents God's fixed standard of righteousness and equity. This concept draws on biblical themes of divine justice and measurement (Ezekiel 40-48; Revelation 21:15-17). (See Meredith Kline, *Kingdom Prologue*, 2000)",

  {
    term: "Covenant Economics",
    definition: "The term 'Covenant Economics' describes an approach to economic life rooted in biblical covenant principles—faithfulness over profit, relationship over transaction, generational flourishing over extraction. This system prioritizes covenant relationships rather than mere contracts, drawing on the biblical theology of covenant as the framework for all human relationships and transactions. (See Scott Hahn, *Kinship by Covenant*, Yale, 2009; Meredith Kline, *Kingdom Prologue*, 2000)",

  {
    term: "Immutable Standard",
    definition: "A fixed, unchanging reference point for value and truth. In the DGE, this refers to the biblical principles that govern token distribution, content integrity, and user engagement—standards that cannot be manipulated or compromised. This reflects the biblical teaching that God's Word and character are unchanging (Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8).",

  {
    term: "Stewardship Under Heaven",
    definition: "The biblical principle that all resources, authority, and influence are held in trust from God and must be managed according to His purposes (Matthew 25:14-30; 1 Corinthians 4:2). This is the foundational ethic of the DGE—users are not consumers, but stewards. This reflects the biblical mandate that humans are stewards, not owners, of creation.",

  {
    term: "The Elect One",
    definition: "A title for the Messiah in 1 Enoch, referring to the one chosen by God to judge the earth and establish righteousness. In the DGE context, this reminds us that all authority and judgment ultimately belong to Christ, not to human systems. This messianic title appears throughout the Parables of Enoch (1 Enoch 37-71) and connects to New Testament Christology. (See Darrell Bock, *Blasphemy and Exaltation*, 1998; George Nickelsburg, *1 Enoch 1*, Fortress, 2001)",

  {
    term: "Throne of Glory",
    definition: "The seat of divine authority from which the Elect One judges all creation (1 Enoch 45:3; 51:3; 61:8). This concept reminds DGE participants that all earthly authority is derivative and accountable to the ultimate King. This imagery connects to biblical throne visions in Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1, and Revelation 4-5.",

    term: "Righteous Judgement",
    definition: "The fair and just evaluation of all actions, motives, and stewardship according to God's unchanging standard (Psalm 96:13; 2 Timothy 4:8). In the DGE, this principle governs how tokens are distributed and how content is valued. This reflects the biblical teaching that God judges with perfect justice.",

  {
    term: "Fixed Foundation, Flexible Form",
    definition: "The leadership principle that the 'why' (purpose and vision) is eternal and unchanging, while the 'how' (methods and structures) is seasonal and adaptive. This allows kingdom builders to remain faithful to the mission while responding to changing circumstances. This principle reflects what theologians call 'contextualization'—the recognition that while divine truth is absolute, its faithful application requires wisdom in varying circumstances. (See D.A. Carson, *The Gagging of God*, Zondervan, 1996; Timothy Keller, *Center Church*, Zondervan, 2012)",

  {
    term: "Rest as Authority",
    definition: "The counterintuitive truth that true leadership includes the ability to rest—not out of laziness, but out of trust in God's sovereignty. Resting leaders demonstrate that they trust the Architect more than their own ability to control outcomes. Biblical rest is never mere inactivity but active trust in God's character. (See Abraham Joshua Heschel, *The Sabbath*, FSG, 1951; Walter Brueggemann, *Sabbath as Resistance*, Westminster John Knox, 2014)",

  {
    term: "Piloting the Permanent",
    definition: "Following Abraham's example of going out 'not knowing where he was going' (Hebrews 11:8), this approach embraces faithful action amid incomplete knowledge. The practice of launching imperfect prototypes and iterating based on real-world feedback, rather than waiting for theoretical perfection. This approach acknowledges that the kingdom is built through faithful action, not endless planning.",

    term: "The Fourfold Kingdom Organism",
    definition: "Building on Paul's body of Christ metaphor (1 Corinthians 12:12-27), this framework proposes a contemporary four-part structure for kingdom coordination: NationOS (Head), DGE (Heart), GodManMarkets (Hands), and LTT Foundation (Immune System). Together, these four parts function as one living body, each serving distinct but complementary roles. While this specific structure is an original application, it reflects the biblical principle of organic unity amid functional diversity. (See Edmund Clowney, *The Church*, IVP, 1995; Howard Snyder, *The Community of the King*, IVP, 1977)",

    term: "Sovereignty",
    definition: "The supreme authority and rule of God over all creation, including economic systems, governments, and individual lives (Psalm 103:19; Daniel 4:34-35). Sovereignty is the foundational truth that undergirds the entire DGE framework. This reflects the biblical teaching that God's rule is absolute and His purposes cannot be thwarted.",

    term: "Generational Stewardship",
    definition: "The practice of building and investing in ways that benefit not only the current generation but also those who come after. This is exemplified by David's preparation for the temple he would never see completed (2 Samuel 7; 1 Chronicles 22-29). The Davidic temple narrative has long been recognized as a paradigm of generational stewardship. (See G.K. Beale, *The Temple and the Church's Mission*, IVP Academic, 2004)",

    term: "The Unfolding",
    definition: "The ongoing, dynamic process by which God's eternal purposes are revealed and implemented in time. The Unfolding acknowledges that we see in part and build in part, trusting the Architect to complete what He has begun. This reflects the 'already but not yet' framework central to New Testament eschatology—the kingdom has been inaugurated in Christ but awaits final consummation.
