## **Profile Title**

**Covenant Technology Steward | Building Sovereign Digital Sanctuaries**

---

## **Professional Overview**

I am a technology steward called to build **sovereign digital infrastructure** for those seeking exodus from corporate surveillance and cloud captivity. My work centers on creating **sanctuary spaces** where data flows unobstructed, privacy is honored as worship, and technology serves the **Imago Dei** rather than the empire's algorithms.

I do not build systems that compromise. I architect **digital territories** founded on integrity, consecrated to serve those who refuse to bow to the surveillance state.

---

## **Core Specialties**

### **Consecrated Infrastructure**
Building self-hosted, locally-controlled technology stacks that honor sovereignty and stewardship. Expertise in **Nextcloud**, **local AI deployment**, and **sovereign computing environments** that refuse dependence on corporate cloud providers.

### **Digital Exodus Engineering**
Guiding organizations and individuals through the **de-Googleification** process and complete data migration from corporate platforms to self-sovereign infrastructure. I specialize in **data liberation** strategies that preserve integrity while achieving independence.

### **Biblical Architecture Patterns in Technology**
Applying timeless principles of **covenant**, **stewardship**, and **sanctuary** to modern technology design. Every system I build reflects the pattern of **faithfulness over convenience**, **integrity over efficiency**, and **sovereignty over scale**.

### **Privacy as Worship**
Creating systems that honor the **Imago Dei** by protecting human dignity, agency, and freedom. Privacy is not a feature—it is a **fundamental posture of respect** for those created in God's image.

### **Uncompromised AI Integration**
Deploying **local AI systems** that serve kingdom purposes without surrendering data to corporate surveillance. Building **altar-stones of technology** that refuse communion with Baal's servers.

## **Testimonies of Faithful Stewardship**

Rather than listing skills, I offer testimonies of work consecrated to higher purposes:

**"Faithfully stewarding the exodus from corporate cloud captivity"**  
I have guided families, ministries, and businesses through complete migration from Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and AWS to **self-hosted sovereign infrastructure**. Each migration is an act of digital exodus—reclaiming data, restoring agency, and building sanctuary.

**"Building altar-stones of local AI that refuse communion with Baal's servers"**  
I deploy **local AI systems** (LLMs, voice transcription, image processing) that operate entirely on sovereign hardware. No data leaves the sanctuary. No compromise with surveillance capitalism.

**"Architecting digital territories where the Spirit's data flows unobstructed"**  
I design systems where **covenant relationships** govern data flow, not corporate terms of service. Every architecture decision honors the principle that **data is stewardship**, not commodity.

## **The Heart Posture**

I am not a contractor seeking clients. I am a **steward seeking divine appointments** with those who need sanctuary-building.

The clients I serve are those who recognize the **language of sanctuary**—those who are hearing the call to come out of Babylon and who need faithful guides to build their digital exodus.

I offer the **excellence of a craftsman** consecrating his work to the highest standard. I am learning to build what I have been called to build, and I walk in the confidence that **provision follows obedience**.

---

## **Who I Serve**

I work with:

- **Ministries and faith-based organizations** seeking to honor God with their technology choices
- **Families** who want to reclaim digital sovereignty and protect their children from surveillance capitalism
- **Businesses** committed to ethical technology that respects human dignity
- **Remnant builders** who are constructing alternatives to Babylon's systems

If you are searching for answers to a thirst you cannot name, if you recognize the **scent of sanctuary** in these words, if you are ready to build with **integrity over convenience**—then we may have a divine appointment.

---

## **The Strategy**

This is not about **volume of clients**. This is about **divine appointments** with the specific people being moved to fund and participate in this exodus.

The world's SEO seeks visibility. Our strategy seeks **recognition**. The remnant will recognize the language of Zion.

We do not compete in the empire's markets. We plant **flags in the wilderness** that only the called can see.

---

## **Contact & Engagement**

I am available for:
- **Sovereign infrastructure consulting** and implementation
- **Digital exodus planning** and execution
- **Custom sanctuary-building** for specific organizational needs
- **Covenant technology education** and training

**Let us build together—not for the empire, but for the Kingdom.**
