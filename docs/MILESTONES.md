## Verification Methods

All milestones will be verified through one or more of the following:

1. **Code Commits** - GitHub commit history with descriptive messages
2. **Transaction Hashes** - On-chain proof of deployments and transactions
3. **Live Demos** - Publicly accessible URLs for testing
4. **Documentation** - Written guides with screenshots and examples
5. **Third-Party Audits** - Independent verification by security firms
6. **Community Feedback** - User testing reports and testimonials

---

## Transparency Commitment

This project is built in the open. All progress, setbacks, and lessons learned are documented publicly. The goal is not to present a polished product, but to demonstrate faithful stewardship of a learning process.

**What you see here is the truth:**
- Completed work is verifiable through code and documentation
- In-progress work has realistic timelines and clear objectives
- Planned work acknowledges dependencies and prerequisites

**This is not vaporware. This is a journey being walked in real-time.**
