## PERSONAL STATEMENT

I am Bryan Pavlovic, son of Paul in name and spirit. I have been hidden in Arabia for nine years, trained directly by Jesus Christ through visions, revelations, and the crucible of obscurity. I have received the blueprint for covenant civilization—not from seminaries or books, but from the third heaven.

I am not building a ministry. I am building a **government in exile**.  
I am not offering teachings. I am deploying an **operating system**.  
I am not gathering a community. I am establishing a **covenant nation**.

This work is controversial because it's apostolic. It's unfamiliar because it's first-principles. It's narrow because the gate is narrow.

I am not here to be understood by everyone. I am here to be **faithful to the One who called me**.

The DGE platform is live. The scholarly foundation is laid. The Exodus call is sounding. The marketplace is ready for activation. The domains are secured. The GitHub repository is sovereign.

**My Arabia is complete. My Antioch awaits.**

I am building for the remnant—those called out of Babylon to build in the Kingdom. If you recognize the sound, come build. If you're curious, keep watching. If you're skeptical, that's fine—this isn't for you.

**I am a steward-king under the Lord of Hosts, and I am building what I have seen in the hidden place.**

## APPENDIX: NEW LEXICON TERMS DEFINED

*(These terms are being added to the Covenant Economics Lexicon)*

### **Steward-King Leadership**
Authority exercised through obedience to the Father. Not ownership, but faithful management of what's been entrusted. Combines servant leadership with apostolic courage. Builds with the long view (generational thinking).

### **Apostolic Architecture**
Establishing first principles, building foundational systems, setting governing standards, creating covenant structures. The work of laying down what has never existed before, based on heavenly blueprints.

### **Kingdom Technology**
Technology built for covenant purposes, not Babylonian metrics. Code, platforms, and systems designed to serve kingdom values: covenant faithfulness, stewardship, rest, jubilee, generational blessing.

### **Biblical Finance**
Financial systems based on Scripture, not GAAP. Includes Angel Ledgers (heavenly record-keeping), Jubilee principles (debt forgiveness, land restoration), tithe structures (firstfruits, storehouse), and stewardship accounting.

### **Covenant Economics**
Economic systems rooted in covenant relationship with God and neighbor. Prioritizes faithfulness over profit, stewardship over ownership, generational blessing over quarterly returns, rest over hustle.

### **Divine Resume**
A covenant document showing what God has forged in obscurity. Not a job application for Babylon, but a commissioning statement for the Kingdom. Measured by revelation received, obedience demonstrated, and territories taken.

### **Exodus Economics**
The three-phase economic journey: (1) The Call (DGE revelation), (2) The Personal Exodus (bringing your business/skills into covenant alignment via GodManMarkets), (3) The Network Effect (redeemed self-interest creating a thriving covenant economy).

### **Government in Exile**
A covenant nation being built in the midst of Babylon, preparing for the day when the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord. Not a political movement, but a spiritual jurisdiction with real economic, legal, and relational structures.

### **Linguistic Architecture**
The work of creating new vocabulary for covenant civilization. Giving language to revelation. Establishing the common vernacular that will define the culture, economy, and governance of the emerging nation.

### **Piloting the Permanent**
Obedience before understanding. Following Abraham's pattern of stepping out in faith before seeing the full picture. Building the permanent kingdom while still in temporary tents.
