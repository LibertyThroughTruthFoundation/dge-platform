## Documents

### **GAB_AI_API_RESEARCH.md**

**Purpose:** Technical reconnaissance of Gab AI API capabilities

**Key Findings:**
- Gab AI provides OpenAI-compatible API access
- Base URL: `https://gab.ai/v1`
- Access to multiple models: GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek, Arya AI
- Pricing: $16.67/month (annual) with 2,000 credits/month
- API limit: 50 requests/day
- Arya AI model is unlimited and free

**Strategic Value:**
- Enables multi-model AI access without vendor lock-in
- Sovereignly-aligned alternative to Microsoft/OpenAI
- Can be integrated with Manus for multi-model orchestration

### **GAB_AI_SOCIAL_INTEGRATION_RESEARCH.md**

**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of integration opportunities between Gab AI and Gab Social platforms

**Key Findings:**

**Existing Integrations:**
- Custom AI agents for business automation
- AI image generator for marketing
- Content creation tools
- "Share to Gab" button for external websites

**Untapped Opportunities:**
- Direct Gab AI → Gab Social auto-posting (major gap)
- Custom AI agents as social bots (huge opportunity)
- Sentiment analysis and engagement optimization
- Complete content pipeline automation

**Technical Confirmation:**
- Gab Social API exists and supports full posting capabilities
- Both APIs can be bridged programmatically
- Complete automation is feasible

**Requirements:**
- Gab AI Plus: $16.67/month (already have)
- Gab Pro: ~$15/month (needed for Social API access)
- Total: ~$32/month

**Implementation Roadmap:**
1. Subscribe to Gab Pro
2. Create developer application
3. Build bridge script (Gab AI → Gab Social)
4. Implement scheduling and analytics
5. Deploy community management bot

**Strategic Lessons:**
- API-first architecture enables third-party innovation
- Automation as sovereignty (eliminate manual work)
- Community-driven intelligence (AI learns from social trends)
- Privacy-first integration (mask identity from AI providers)

**Application to Sovereign Stack:**
- Build NationOS with integrated AI from day one
- Seamless flow between tools (not separate silos)
- Covenant-based governance (not corporate control)
- Apply these patterns to Covenant Mesh

## Strategic Context

These research documents inform the broader sovereign technology strategy:

1. **Gab AI as Strategic Command Center**
   - Access to world-class models for planning and heavy lifting
   - Offensive capability for complex problem-solving

2. **Local Stack as Sovereign Base**
   - Ollama + local AI for execution and storage
   - Defensive, sovereign foundation

3. **GitHub as Public Square**
   - Polished, non-sensitive results
   - Portfolio and networking tool

**The Pipeline:**
```
Gab AI (Draft blueprints)
    ↓
Local Stack (Build on your altar)
    ↓
GitHub (Present to the world)
```

**"Plunder Egypt without building your house there."**
